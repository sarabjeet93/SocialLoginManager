# SocialLoginManager
We can use this class when we integrate multiple login method in a project. In this file i have used two different social login (facebook, google) for login into app, each one have their own separate class. If you want to add any other login so just need to create a new class like Facebook and GoogleLoginManager and use through SocialLoginManager class.
